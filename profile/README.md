# bab – A Minimalist, Dependency-Free Task Runner

**bab** is an open-source project that aims to rethink how developers manage tasks and workflows in their projects. Unlike traditional solutions such as Makefiles or npm scripts, **bab** focuses on simplicity, clarity, and minimal dependencies, making automation accessible to everyone.

## 🌱 Project Philosophy

The core idea behind **bab** is to provide a lightweight, intuitive tool that helps developers focus on what matters: writing code and automating repetitive tasks without the overhead of complex configuration or external dependencies. 

- **Simplicity over complexity**: Automate tasks with minimal setup.
- **Universal workflows**: Works for small scripts and large-scale projects alike.
- **Readable configuration**: Task definitions are straightforward and easy to understand.

## 🛠️ Motivation

Managing project workflows can be cumbersome. Developers often face:

- Bloated task runners with unnecessary dependencies.
- Confusing configuration files.
- Difficulty in sharing scripts across different operating systems.

**bab** addresses these issues by offering a **single, unified solution** that is lightweight, cross-platform, and easy to maintain.

## 📖 Getting Started

To use **bab**, create a `Babfile` in your project directory and define your tasks:

```bash
task default:
  echo "Hello, World!"
